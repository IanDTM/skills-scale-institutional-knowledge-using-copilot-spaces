# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation. This collection provides a practical framework for managing cross-functional projects from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or an experienced contributor looking for a specific guideline, these documents offer clear, actionable guidance on how we run projects. OctoAcme follows an iterative lifecycle that emphasizes customer value, incremental delivery, and psychological safety.

Projects progress through five core phases: **Initiation** (problem statement, stakeholder alignment, and high-level timeline), **Planning** (scope definition, backlog creation, and resource allocation), **Execution** (building, testing, reviewing, and iterating), **Release** (deployment, verification, and announcement), and **Retrospective/Continuous Improvement** (capturing learnings and action items). Our workflow centers on project board stages that track work from backlog through done. We use a structured pull request process that ensures quality through code reviews, CI checks, and acceptance criteria validation.

Key roles include the **Project Manager (PM)** who coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; the **Product Manager (PdM)** who defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success; **Developers** who implement features and collaborate on design; **QA/Testing** specialists who validate quality and acceptance criteria; and **Stakeholders** who provide inputs and approvals. Communication follows a consistent cadence: weekly syncs between PM and PdM, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates. Escalations follow a clear path from team level to PM to Product Lead to Sponsor. Special protocols exist for security incidents.

Quality assurance is built into every step of our process. We require comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) and automated CI/CD pipelines that validate builds and tests on every commit. Code reviews require at least one approval before merging. Explicit release checklists verify acceptance criteria, documentation, and rollback procedures. This multi-layered approach ensures we deliver reliable, maintainable software while maintaining velocity and reducing production incidents.
